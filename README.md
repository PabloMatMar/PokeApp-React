# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. (First time you need run `npm i` to install dependencies)

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

I like to check that my applications not only do what they are supposed to do, but also that they don't do what they are not supposed to do. Run the npm test command and wait. Press a key when the console prompts, then you will see an image like this:![Testig Whit Jest](./public/assets/testWhitJest.png )
You can see in each component the snapshot with all small the tests that each test does.

[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `netlify deploy --prod`

Deploys the app in the prod url, so it's available. The command will require you:
-Choice "Link this directory
 to an existing site" and choice again "poke-app-pablo"
-Include the directory in which the app's build is in. In this case, the directory is ./build.
