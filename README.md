# Poke-app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome to the Pokeapp!

## home

This application will allow you to see the 902 existing pokemon. You can see them on the home route.

## Details

In each pokemon you can click on details, this will take you to the details route. In it you can choose with what style of drawing you can see the pokemon, and if you want to see the normal or shiny way. You will also see:
- Their typologies
- Your size and weight
- His attacks

## Search

In the nav-bar you can go to the search section, there you can put the name of the specific pokemon you are looking for, from there you will also have access to details.

## Add a pokemon

Finally if you want to have more fun you can go add a new pokemon in the new route, here you can create a pokemon only with the basics or adding all the details. This will be included in the home list.
